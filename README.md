# Do not walk away from Complexity, Run - Venkat Subramaniam

## Excessive configuration  

   - Configuration in XML
   - Configuration from hell
   - XML is like humans, cute when small, annoying as it gets bigger.  
   - Brittle  
   - Error prone  
   - Hard to deploy  
   - Hard to test  
   - Hard to reason  
   - Invisible changes  
   - Two kinds of code frutraste me:  
      - One that won't work;  
      - One that works, but shouldn't.  
   - Don't sneak around and change state  

## Unnecessary components  

   - Uncontrolled mutability  
   - "Mutability actually causes brain damage." - Venkat Subramaniam  
   - "It worked before!" - Venkat Subramaniam  
   - "He's wired in."  
   - Happiness is when the world understands programmers. - Venkat Subramaniam  
   - Lack of Cohesion (Does too many things at same time.)  
   - Frequency of changes  
   - Excessive dependencies  
   - Dependencies are hard to maintain, obsolete quickly, becomes incompatible  
   - Technology infatuation  
   - Resibility? The ability to back out of design/architectural decisions.  
   - Library vs Framework (Resibility and cost to use then)  
   - The use of library is easier to reverse then use of framework.  
   - Using a library is like dating, using a framework is like marriage.  
   - Don't build what you can download  
   - Don't download what you really do not need  
   - Accidental complexity: Low level concurrency  
   - Declarative helps keep focus on What instead of How  
   - Entwinement  
   - "Completing things is the source of Complexity." - Rich Hickey
   - We should learn to dead with complexity and have the wisdom to minimize it.
   - A maintanable code is a gift we give ourselves for the future.
